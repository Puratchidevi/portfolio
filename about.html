      <p class="about-desc">
        I am a motivated and enthusiastic Frontend Developer with a strong interest in creating clean, responsive, and user-friendly web interfaces. I enjoy learning new concepts and turning simple ideas into functional websites using structured and readable code.

I have basic hands-on experience in building responsive web pages that work well across different screen sizes. I focus on practicing regularly, improving my coding skills, and understanding best practices in frontend development.

I am familiar with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React, and I like experimenting with layouts, colors, and simple animations to make websites more engaging. I believe animations should enhance the user experience without affecting performance.

I am a quick learner, self-driven, and always eager to improve my skills. As a fresher, my goal is to gain real-world experience, learn from industry professionals, and grow into a confident frontend developer while contributing positively to projects.
